# What this is about?
So we took part in competition where the first team who makes a working program wins, 
as you can guess we didn't make it in time so yeah this code in our final version that we could give to commission.

##What does this do?
Its sort of winrar or 7zip but more retarded, it just simply packs files into one.

##Usage
How do I start it? 
>Since it has no GUI only way to start this abomination is through console/terminal

How do I do it?
> Open up console/terminal make sure your JRE is installed and type the command listed below

>java -jar OrderOfCode2018.jar

##Commands
they are listed at program startup but unfortunately they are half-english and half-polish because commission specs require them that way.

Quick translation:

1. PACZKA - PACKAGE
2. PLIK - FILE
3. KOMENTARZ - COMMENT

##Credits/Team
